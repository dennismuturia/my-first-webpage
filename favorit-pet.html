    <h1>Simba,<em>My Pet</em></h1>
    <h3>This is the tale about my pet Dog</h3>
    <p>We have had to put a Simba Kali sign up the gate to deter intruders. But to us his homies
    he as friendly as it can get. The dude likes to play </p>
    <p>Some of his favourite toys include:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Rubber bone</li>
      <li>Worn out slippers</li>
      <li>Those daring butterflies(will keep him occupied)</li>
      <li>The legs of a thief</li>
    </ol>
    <p>But to do this he really needs energy. We thus always ensure that at the right times,
      two times daily his bowl is full with one of the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Ugali</li>
        <li>Raw Meat</li>
        <li>Wild Rabbits</li>
        <li>The legs of a thief</li>
      </ol>
